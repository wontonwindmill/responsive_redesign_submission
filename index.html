    <p>I chose this website because it looked outdated to me upon first glance, and upon second glance seemed to have some problems with responsiveness and readability. </p>
    <p>Usability: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Poor contrast makes it difficult to read text</li>
      <li>Learnability, memorability, and efficiency is good with the navigation and organization of the site, with well sectioned pages. Buttons could have better hover qualities.</li>
      <li>Visual hierarchy could use some work, with sections of text feeled smushed together </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Accessibility: 
      <br>There were a few problems with this site, namely low contrast on the text due to the choice in background. Also there was no language attribute and no alt tags for images.</p>
